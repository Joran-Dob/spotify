Absolutely unusable.**

## Usage

---

Import the module and initialise the `Client` class.

```ts
import { Client } from "https://deno.land/x/spotify/mod.ts";

// Create the API client
const spotify = new Client({
  token: "your_token",
  refresh_token: "refresh_token",
});
```

Make calls to the API

```ts
const artist = spotify.getArtist("joji");

for (const image of artist.images) {
  console.log(image.height, image.url, image.width);
}
```

**More usage in `/examples`** -- `TODO`

## Develop

---

To run tests locally all you need to do is export `"spotify_access_token"` to
your env.

```ini
export spotify_access_token="Bearer [token]"
```

Then just run them with

```ini
deno test -A --unstable
```
